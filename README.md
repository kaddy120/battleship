# Battleship Game

A classic battleship game built with vanilla `JavaScript` and developed
using Test-Driven Development(TDD) methodology. This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) curriculum.

The player can select the position of their ships and play against a computer.
